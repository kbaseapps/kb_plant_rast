    <p>This App was released in conjunction with PlantSEED v2 (see publications). It takes a Genome object as an input and annotates the protein-coding genes with metabolic functions using the RAST algorithm. It integrates the set of signature k-mers that were trained as part of the PlantSEED v2 project, wherein every k-mer is unique and associated with a single metabolic function. The App will scan the protein sequences for hits and assign the function accordingly. The annotations are linked to biochemical reactions, and researchers may use the <a href=”https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/fba_tools/build_plant_metabolic_model/beta”>Reconstruct Plant Metabolism</a> App (currently in beta) to follow up and build a working model of plant primary metabolism. Note: we did not integrate protein localization data when training the k-mers, and this impacts the compartmentalization of gene-protein-reactions (GPRs) in metabolic reconstructions. For more reliably compartmentalized GPRs, you may instead annotate your genome using the <a href=”https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_orthofinder/annotate_plant_transcripts/release”>Annotate Plant Enzymes with OrthoFinder</a> App.</p>
