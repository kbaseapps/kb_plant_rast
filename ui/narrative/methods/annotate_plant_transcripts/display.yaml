    <p>This app is released in conjunction with PlantSEED v2 (see
    publications). It integrates the set of signature k-mers that were
    trained as part of the PlantSEED v2 project, wherein every k-mer
    is unique, and associated with a single metabolic function. The
    app will scan the protein sequences for hits and assign the
    function accordingly. The annotations are linked to biochemical
    reactions, and researchers may use the "Build Metabolic Model"
    app. Please note: we did not integrate protein localization data
    when training the k-mers and this impacts compartmentalization of
    GPRs in our metabolic reconstructions. For more reliably
    compartmentalized GPRs, you may instead annotate your genome using
    the "Annotate Plant Enzymes with OrthoFinder" app.</p>
